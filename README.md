To Study &amp; Implement Sorting Algorithm.

## Aim 

To study and implement sorting algorithms and understand their working principles, efficiency, and application.

## Theory
Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Sorting is fundamental because it optimizes searching, data organization, and algorithm efficiency.

### Types of Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**  
   - Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
   - Simple but inefficient for large datasets.  
   - Time Complexity: Best case O(n), Worst case O(n²).

2. **Selection Sort**  
   - Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.  
   - Efficient for small datasets.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n²) in all cases.

3. **Insertion Sort**  
   - Builds a sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements at the correct position.  
   - Efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.  
   - Time Complexity: Best case O(n), Worst case O(n²).

4. **Merge Sort**  
   - Divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges the sorted halves.  
   - Efficient and stable.  
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) for all cases.

5. **Quick Sort**  
   - Selects a pivot element, partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and sorts recursively.  
   - Fast and efficient for large datasets.  
   - Time Complexity: Best/Average O(n log n), Worst O(n²).

## Procedure
1. Understand the logic of the chosen sorting algorithm.  
2. Open a programming IDE or online compiler and create a new project/file.  
3. Take input from the user for the number of elements and the array elements.  
4. Implement the sorting algorithm step by step:  
   - **Bubble Sort**: Compare and swap adjacent elements.  
   - **Selection Sort**: Find minimum in unsorted array and swap with first unsorted element.  
   - **Insertion Sort**: Insert each element at its correct position.  
   - **Merge Sort**: Recursively divide, sort, and merge arrays.  
   - **Quick Sort**: Partition array around a pivot and sort recursively.  
5. Print the sorted array.  
6. Test the program with different cases: random order, already sorted, reverse order.  
7. Analyze the time and space complexity and discuss suitability for different dataset sizes.

## Conclusion
- Sorting algorithms organize data efficiently and are fundamental in computer science.  
- **Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sorts** are simple and suitable for small datasets.  
- **Merge and Quick Sorts** are efficient for larger datasets due to divide-and-conquer strategies.  
- Understanding sorting algorithms improves performance in searching and data-processing tasks.
